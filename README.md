## üëã Hi, I'm Samarth Narula

I‚Äôm a data science and machine learning enthusiast, currently pursuing a Diploma in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras (CGPA: 8.75).
Alongside, I work as a Deputy Research Manager at Sambodhi Research and Communications, applying statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to large-scale evaluation projects.

My interest in data science is rooted deeper ‚Äî having played competitive football growing up, I developed a fascination with anticipation, prediction, and pattern recognition. Whether it was on the field or in strategic games like chess, the challenge of making sense of complex situations naturally extended into my academic and technical journey.

Data Science allows me to move beyond surface-level analytics: to understand data at its core, think in terms of random variables and uncertainty, clean and shape data meaningfully, and tweak models with intuition backed by strong mathematical foundations ‚Äî leading up to those moments where patterns click, and insights emerge.
